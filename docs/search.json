Students will learn how to create these displays, how to understand them, and how to distinguish when and where particular graphics are appropriate. This course uses R, RStudio, ggplot2 and its extensions, and R Markdown.\nSpecific objectives:\nCreate statistical graphics.\nUnderstand the fundamentals of data and reproducible data analysis.\nWrite about statistical graphics.\nSpeak about statistical graphics and data analyses.\nAssess and critique statistical graphics.\nLectures\nLecture slides are available below in html format, and the .Rmd files are linked from GitHub.\nLecture\nTopic\nhtml\nRmd\n1\nintro and why data viz\n\n\n2\nthe grammar of graphics\n\n\n3\nbar graphs\n\n\n4\nvisualizing distributions\n\n\n5\nline graphs & working with time\n\n\n6\nscatter plots & relational data\n\n\n7\ngrab bag (pie charts, heat maps, maps)\n\n\n8\ntaking plots to the next level\n\n\n9\ncolors, fonts, annotations, themes\n\n\n10\nextensions to ggplot2\n\n\n11\nmidterm review\n\n\n12\nmodel output visualizations from tidymodels & user-defined functions\n\n\n13\ntext analysis with tidytext and tables with kableExtra\n\n\n13\ntables with gt and gtsummary\n\n\n14\npresentations with xaringan\n\n\n15\nanimation with gganimate, interactivity with plotly, and iteration with purrr\n\n\nLabs\nLab slides are available below in html format, and the .Rmd files are available at the GitHub repo linked in the nav bar above.\nLab 1\nLab 2\nLab 3\nLab 4\nLab 5\nLab 6\nLab 8\nResources\nData Visualization\nFundamentals of Data Visualization: https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html\nData Visualization: A Practical Introduction: https://socviz.co/index.html#preface\nThe tidyverse\nBest resource for overall analysis in R using the tidyverse: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\nggplot2\nggplot2 book: https://ggplot2-book.org/\nThe ggplot2 cheatsheet: https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/STAT3022/r/current/Misc/data-visualization-2.1.pdf\nDetails of various charts made in R: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html\nCreating custom themes: https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-12-26-creating-and-using-custom-ggplot2-themes/\nR Graphics cookbook: https://r-graphics.org/\nA guide to various scales: https://ggplot2tor.com/scales\nR Markdown\nThe definitive guide to R Markdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/\nR Markdown reference guide: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf\nR Markdown cheat sheet: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf\nAcknowledgments\nThis website is made with the distill package.
