## Course Objectives

This course introduces the most common forms of graphical displays along with their uses and misuses. Students will learn how to create these displays, how to understand them, and how to distinguish when and where particular graphics are appropriate. This course uses R, RStudio, `ggplot2` and its extensions, and R Markdown.

Specific objectives:

1. Create statistical graphics.
2. Understand the fundamentals of data and reproducible data analysis.
3. Write about statistical graphics.
4. Speak about statistical graphics and data analyses.
5. Assess and critique statistical graphics.
